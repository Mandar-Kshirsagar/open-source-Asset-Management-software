- Query validation and syntax checking
- Read-only operations only (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Query timeout protection (30 seconds)
- Comprehensive audit logging

### 4. User Experience
- Real-time chat interface with floating widget

- Formatted result display in readable tables
- Error handling with helpful suggestions
- Built-in help system with examples
- Chat history export functionality
- Draggable chat window with responsive design

### 5. Database Schema Coverage
**Supported Tables:**
- Assets (asset information, status, assignments)
- Users (user accounts, roles, profiles)
- AssetHistories (change tracking, movements)
- MaintenanceRecords (maintenance activities)
- RefreshTokens (authentication management)

**Relationship Understanding:**
- Asset-to-User assignments
- Asset-to-Maintenance associations
- Asset-to-History tracking
- Foreign key relationships

## API Endpoints Created

### Chatbot Controller (`/api/chatbot/`)
- `POST /message` - Send messages to AI chatbot
- `GET /schema` - Get database schema information
- `GET /schema/description` - Get AI-friendly schema description
- `POST /query` - Execute custom SQL (Admin/Manager only)
- `POST /validate-query` - Validate SQL without execution
- `GET /stats` - Get database statistics
- `GET /help` - Get chatbot capabilities and examples
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Example Usage

### Natural Language Queries Supported:
```
"Show me all assets" → SELECT * FROM Assets
"How many laptops do we have?" → SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Assets WHERE Category LIKE '%laptop%'
"Find Dell computers" → SELECT * FROM Assets WHERE Brand LIKE '%Dell%' AND Category LIKE '%computer%'
"Who has the most assets?" → Complex JOIN with GROUP BY
"List unassigned assets" → SELECT * FROM Assets WHERE AssignedToUserId IS NULL
"What maintenance was done last month?" → JOIN query with date filtering
```

2. Run the Angular frontend
3. Login to the system (JWT authentication required)
4. Click the chat bubble in the bottom-right corner
5. Try example queries like:
   - "Hello" (greeting test)
   - "Help" (help system test)
   - "Show me all assets" (basic query test)
   - "How many users do we have?" (count query test)

### Health Check:
- Access `/api/chatbot/health` to verify system status
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Monitor backend logs for SQL generation and execution

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues:
1. **Authentication errors**: Check JWT token validity
2. **SQL generation failures**: Verify natural language contains recognizable entities
3. **Query execution errors**: Check database connectivity and permissions
4. **Frontend connection issues**: Verify API URL configuration

### Debugging Steps:
1. Check application logs for detailed error information
2. Use browser developer tools for frontend debugging
3. Test API endpoints directly with tools like Postman
4. Verify database connectivity and schema access

## Conclusion

The AI-powered SQL chatbot system has been successfully implemented with comprehensive functionality, robust security measures, and an intuitive user interface. The system provides a natural language interface to the AMS database while maintaining enterprise-level security and performance standards.

The implementation is production-ready and includes all necessary components for deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. The modular design allows for easy extension and enhancement as requirements evolve.
